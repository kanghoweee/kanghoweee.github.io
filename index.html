                <h3>Making and Tinkering Project (BALL-E) - Team Lead</h3>
                <p>As Team Lead, I led the development of an autonomous spherical robot for drain inspection that chilnched the Best Idea award. I conceptualized the robot's architecture, managed budgets, and coordinated tasks, ensuring the timely completion of our project. Additionally, I took charge of integrating software with hardware components and debugging analog/digital signals. Our functional prototype received commendations from Singaporeâ€™s Public Utilities Board (PUB).</p>

                <p>As the Electrical Lead from January 2023 to September 2023, I architected signal circuitry, troubleshooted microcontroller issues, and optimized PID feedback control. I also integrated depth sensors into the existing software stack, enhancing the vehicle's autonomy and functionality. I also conducted live pool tests to ensure the reliability of the systems underwater.</p>

                <h3>NTU Radio Frequency Laboratory - PCB Design Intern</h3>
                <p>During my internship at NTU's Radio Frequency Laboratory, I designed a high-speed wireless transmitter PCB for NTU's EEE department. This included creating the schematic, board layout, and overseeing fabrication. I focused on maintaining signal integrity and noise tolerances through techniques like ground planes and differential pair routing, ensuring the PCB met rigorous performance standards.

                <p>As the backend developer for my hackathon team, I utilized Python and Matplotlib to fuse computer vision data from OpenCV and simulated GPS positions. In doing so, I successfully implemented a fluid mechanics-based algorithm and adhered to object-oriented programming principles in creating the final algorithm. We presented our project at the Google Asia-Pacific HQ in Singapore, and came in 2nd place at the hackathon.</p>

                <p>During the semester break, I decided to embark on a fun self-initiated project at NTU's student makerspace, crafting an Aerodynamic Glider. With a focus on practicality and craftsmanship, I meticulously applied woodworking techniques to shape and refine the glider's structure. This project provided an exciting opportunity to explore aerodynamics while honing my hands-on skills. Through this endeavor, I not only expanded my knowledge of aircraft design but also showcased my ability to translate theoretical concepts into tangible creations through hands-on craftsmanship.</p>
